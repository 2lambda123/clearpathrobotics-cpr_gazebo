Clearpath Additional Simulation Worlds
==========================================

This repository contains additional indoor and outdoor simulation environments for use with Clearpath's robot platforms.


Agriculture World
-------------------------------------------------------------

![Agriculture World](cpr_agriculture_gazebo/docs/agriculture_world.png "Agriculture World")

This is a flat, outdoor world with a barn, fences, and a medium-sized solar farm.

See [Agriculture World](cpr_agriculture_gazebo/docs/README.md)


Inspection World
-------------------------------------------------------------

![Inspection World](cpr_inspection_gazebo/docs/inspection_world.png "Inpsection World")

This is a hilly, outdoor world featuring a bridge, cave/mine, water, small solar farm, and water pipes.

See [Inspection World](cpr_inspection_gazebo/docs/README.md)


Obstacle World
-------------------------------------------------------------

This world features two maps featuring non-planar ground and many solid walls:

![Obstacle World](cpr_obstacle_gazebo/docs/obstacle_world.png "Obstacle World")

A small, fully-enclosed environment with narrow doorways and small indentations in the floor.  Smaller robots
may get stuck if they drive into the holes.

![Obstacle and Ramp World](cpr_obstacle_gazebo/docs/obstacle_ramp_world.png "Obstacle and Ramp World")

A larger, fully-enclosed world with walls and ramps.  This very non-planar environment will pose a challenge to
many localization and mapping algorithms.

See [Obstacle World](cpr_obstacle_gazebo/docs/README.md)


Office World
-------------------------------------------------------------

This world features two maps with the same general floorplan:

![Office World](cpr_office_gazebo/docs/office_world.png "Office World")

A small office featuring hallways, meeting rooms, and furniture.

![Office World](cpr_office_gazebo/docs/construction_world.png "Construction World")

The same office, but undergoing construction.  Construction materials are piled on the floor, and several walls are
only studs.

See [Office World](cpr_office_gazebo/docs/README.md)


Orchard World
-------------------------------------------------------------

![Orchard World](cpr_orchard_gazebo/docs/whole-world.png "Orchard World")

This is a flat, outdoor world with several rows of small trees separated by dirt paths

Race Modules
-------------------------------------------------------------

This is not an actual environment, but rather a collection of concrete and dirt road segments that can be used
to build race tracks.
